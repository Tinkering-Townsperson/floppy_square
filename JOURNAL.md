# July 31st morning: Started the project, research

So I started working around 9am ish, and came up with an idea for a project: A simple flappy bird game on a round display I had laying around. This was quite out of my comfort zone, as I had never used this kind of display before, and although I've had it for some time, the first time I ever saw it in use was at undercity (I believe it was the same model but I may be wrong.) on the Minion robot. I went ahead and started researching how to even go about connect the display, and after some trial and error, I came upon [this article](https://cebess.wordpress.com/2024/04/19/raspberry-pico-and-gc9a01-round-display-in-micropython/) which shows how to use it in micropython. I was originally thinking about using circuitpython, but for now I have opted to follow the instructions and figure out the display. So far, I have the test code and I have wired everything up with my Orpheus pico. I haven't actually tested it yet, as I haven't soldered the display yet. Will do that now. Wish me luck!

Next steps:

- solder display
- schematic
- add buttons
