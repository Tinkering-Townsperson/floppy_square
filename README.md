I made this project because I wanted to squeeze in one final highway project before the deadline, and I used components I had lying around. My idea was to make a nostalgic childhood game, Flappy Bird, although I have since decided to switch to a chrome dino kind of game. Not everything went to plan, like when I accidentally soldered the GND and VCC pins on my display, bricking it and being unable to test the project.
